<!-- EXAMPLE CODE HEADER/DISCLAIMER
 
Project: Project 1-'About Me' Web Page
Name: Ryne Dalrymple
Submitted: 8/31/22
 
I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that if I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  I had to make sure there was enough spacing in my different sections on this project.
My webpage is looking a lot better with the css and different features. There's a lot of fonts to choose from with the
additional web page fonts. It's nice to make your own image look a lot better.

There was a lot more research I had to do to be able to get everything to look the way I wanted. This took a lot longer
than the first one and I had to do a lot more simple commits this time to play around the different css tags.
I can't wait to learn some JavaScript to make the webpage more interactive.

                <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>

                <p class='paragraph'>I've always been interested in Video Games ever since I was 5 years old. I've been playing on PC, Nintendo 64, Super Nintendo, PS2, and all the latest consoles. Playing Video Games really helped me become more social with school and sports
                    I love playing games with friends as they can go from being casual fun to competitive. I won't ever give up on playing video games as it is a part of who I am and what I love.
                </p>

                <p class='paragraph'>I have always been interested in sports my whole life since my family is big on sports and we are big fans of Baseball. When I was younger I watched the Chicago Cubs on WGN with my father and suprisingly, I was named after a hall of fame
                    baseball player, Ryne Sandberg off the Chicago Cubs. Growing up I have loved watching all sports and I can say there isn't a sport that I don't like. Football & Basketball are part of my top 3 sports as well as baseball being my number
                    1. It's nice to have sports in different seasons, so I have something to look forward to every few months in the year.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">I also love YouTube because I get to see video game tutorials and watch documentaries of my interest. One of my favorite YouTube Creators is ZeRoyalViking and he is a gaming commentator. He has great videos with great content and I like
                    that he is interactive with his fans. Guess you could say I am a nerd as I am very much of an introvert and spend most my time on or working with computers.
