        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
        
        <p>I've always been interested in Video Games. Ever since I was 5 years old I've been playing on PC, Nintendo 64, 
            Super Nintendo, PS2, and all the newer ones going up to present. With friends, video games can be from casual to competitive.
            Playing Video Games really helped me become more social with school and sports. In my whole life I probably won't ever give up on video games.
        </p>

        <p>Sports have always been interesting to me my whole life. It first started with baseball when I was younger
            when I watched the Chicago Cubs on WGN. I was named after a hall of fame baseball player, Ryne Sandberg
            off the Chicago Cubs. There isn't a sport that I don't like. Football then basketball would be my number 2
            and number 3. It's nice to have sports in different seasons, so I have something to look forward every
            few months in the year.
        </p>

        <p>Another hobby of mine is watching Youtube. I've watch a lot of video ever since it first came out in
            2005. This is one thing my girlfriend and I like to watch other than other TV shows on Netflix, Hulu,
            and etc. Youtube has come a long way with the good and the bad of course with the Youtubers. If there is nothing on TV
            that I think is good to watch at the time, I can always know there are videos I can watch on Youtube.
