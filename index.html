I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  It was a lot of fun to be able to make a webpage using all the different tags I
needed to use. It's cool all the customization you're able to use to make your webpage not so bland. There is
a lot more I could use on my webpage, but I'm just scratching the surface with the basic customizations.

The biggest thing I had trouble with in the beginning was setting up quokka with the node.js being installed in
the right place of my system, so that would be working for Project 2 coming up. Setting up the pages on github
wasn't as hard, but it did take some time to make it perfect. I don't want to have to try and fix it at the end.
The hardest thing on the actual project was making sure the schedule table was perfect and had no errors.

            <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>

            <p>I've always been interested in Video Games. Ever since I was 5 years old I've been playing on PC, Nintendo 64, Super Nintendo, PS2, and all the newer ones going up to present. With friends, video games can be from casual to competitive. Playing
                Video Games really helped me become more social with school and sports. In my whole life I probably won't ever give up on video games.
            </p>

            <p>Sports have always been interesting to me my whole life. It first started with baseball when I was younger when I watched the Chicago Cubs on WGN. I was named after a hall of fame baseball player, Ryne Sandberg off the Chicago Cubs. There
                isn't a sport that I don't like. Football then basketball would be my number 2 and number 3. It's nice to have sports in different seasons, so I have something to look forward every few months in the year.
            </p>

            <p>Another hobby of mine is watching Youtube. I've watch a lot of video ever since it first came out in 2005. This is one thing my girlfriend and I like to watch other than other TV shows on Netflix, Hulu, and etc. Youtube has come a long way
                with the good and the bad of course with the Youtubers. If there is nothing on TV that I think is good to watch at the time, I can always know there are videos I can watch on Youtube.
