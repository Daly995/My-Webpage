I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  It was a lot of fun to be able to make a webpage using all the different tags I
needed to use. It's cool all the customization you're able to use to make your webpage not so bland. There is
a lot more I could use on my webpage, but I'm just scratching the surface with the basic customizations.

The biggest thing I had trouble with in the beginning was setting up quokka with the node.js being installed in
the right place of my system, so that would be working for Project 2 coming up. Setting up the pages on github
wasn't as hard, but it did take some time to make it perfect. I don't want to have to try and fix it at the end.
The hardest thing on the actual project was making sure the schedule table was perfect and had no errors.

        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>

        <p>I've always been interested in Video Games. Ever since I was 5 years old I've been playing on PC, Nintendo
            64,<br>
            Super Nintendo, PS2, and all the newer ones going up to present. With friends, video games can be from
            casual<br> to competitive.
            Playing Video Games really helped me become more social with school and sports. In my<br> whole life I
            probably
            won't ever give up on video games.
        </p>

        <p>Sports have always been interesting to me my whole life. It first started with baseball when I was
            younger<br>
            when I watched the Chicago Cubs on WGN. I was named after a hall of fame baseball player, Ryne<br> Sandberg
            off the Chicago Cubs. There isn't a sport that I don't like. Football then basketball would<br> be my number
            2
            and number 3. It's nice to have sports in different seasons, so I have something<br> to look forward every
            few months in the year.
        </p>

        <p>Another hobby of mine is watching Youtube. I've watch a lot of video ever since it first came out in<br>
            2005. This is one thing my girlfriend and I like to watch other than other TV shows on Netflix, Hulu,<br>
            and etc. Youtube has come a long way with the good and the bad of course with the Youtubers.<br> If there is
            nothing on TV
            that I think is good to watch at the time, I<br> can always know there are videos I can watch on
            Youtube.<br>
        </p>
