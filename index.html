I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  It was a lot of fun to be able to make a webpage using all the different tags I
needed to use. It's cool all the customization you're able to use to make your webpage not so bland. There is
a lot more I could use on my webpage, but I'm just scratching the surface with the basic customizations.

The biggest thing I had trouble with in the beginning was setting up quokka with the node.js being installed in
the right place of my system, so that would be working for Project 2 coming up. Setting up the pages on github
wasn't as hard, but it did take some time to make it perfect. I don't want to have to try and fix it at the end.
The hardest thing on the actual project was making sure the schedule table was perfect and had no errors.

                <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>

                <p class='paragraph'>I've always been interested in Video Games ever since I was 5 years old. I've been playing on PC, Nintendo 64, Super Nintendo, PS2, and all the latest consoles. Playing Video Games really helped me become more social with school and sports
                    I love playing games with friends as they can go from being casual fun to competitive. I won't ever give up on playing video games as it is a part of who I am and what I love.
                </p>

                <p class='paragraph'>I have always been interested in sports my whole life since my family is big on sports and we are big fans of Baseball. When I was younger I watched the Chicago Cubs on WGN with my father and suprisingly, I was named after a hall of fame
                    baseball player, Ryne Sandberg off the Chicago Cubs. Growing up I have loved watching all sports and I can say there isn't a sport that I don't like. Football & Basketball are part of my top 3 sports as well as baseball being my number
                    1. It's nice to have sports in different seasons, so I have something to look forward to every few months in the year.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">I also love YouTube because I get to see video game tutorials and watch documentaries of my interest. One of my favorite YouTube Creators is ZeRoyalViking and he is a gaming commentator. He has great videos with great content and I like
                    that he is interactive with his fans. Guess you could say I am a nerd as I am very much of an introvert and spend most my time on or working with computers.
